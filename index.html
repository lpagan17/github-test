    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alex says</strong> - "I don't have a specific memory but I do have things cherish about him. He is the heart of the group, the one that keeps the rest of the party alive with support, the moral compass, and an excellent note taker. He is also a man of strong faith, even though his dice give him low rolls, he always believes in the next one. Jeremy you're an awesome person never stop being you."</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emanuel says</strong> - "My all time favorite Jeremy character moment was Deku standing up to Valandras and Wulf when they attacked sarenrae."

        <strong>Alondra says</strong> - "Haberte conocido fue una verdadera bendición. Tu aura, tu ser, tu alma siempre transmite paz, calma y serenidad. Espero que nunca se te apague tu aura tan tranquila y única. Ya que con eso se que llegaras lejos y lograrás todo lo que te propongas. Realmente eres una persona increíble, y no hay nadie como tú. Espero que Dios te bendiga hoy, mañana y siempre en abundancia. Ahora a trabajar y echarle muchas ganas, que el camino no sera fácil, pero jamas imposible. Cualquier cosa sabes que aquí estoy a la orden y mi mamá vive en Florida, que cualquier pregunta que tengas me dejas saber y te puedo dar su número.
Gracias por tu amistad, se que nos vamos a seguir viendo y conociendo mas, sea aquí en PR o allá en Florida."

        <strong>Paulo says</strong> - How could a young halfling start his adventure without a nana that cooks for him. I joined the group a random day on campaign 2. Who would have thought that after two years I’d be still here hoping to have many more years of Dungeons and Dragons with my first group. Among all of them, a good hearted man named Jeremy, showed me how with few words and proper attention you can be so impactful to a story. Who can best build an amazing character with awesome concepts and descriptions without breaking the rules in the books. (Let’s not talk about the mystic hahahahah). Jeremy, you showed me that in D&D, simple could be so much more. You never ask anyone what to play or if they like what you build. That’s because your characters are so unique, like you, they are what you need them to be; and that I admire from you. Although your rolls are not the best, I will never forget that horrible day you rolled like 15 natural 1s in the LMoP game. I will never forget the first time you unleashed your werewolf form in Icewind Dale. You thrive to search and uncover the plot that we truly need in our group…I’m scared we will not, as group, progress in story without you and I’m going to miss you for that and much more. You marked each and everyone of us differently and I hope this is a 'till later. Roll with advantage Jeremy.

        <strong>Christian says</strong> - Jeremy, the first time I met you it was easy to tell that you were the only sane person among us. Always calm and collected, truly the only thing that would stop us from doing dumb shit most of the time. You are a great person and an even better friend. Here's to a see you later and not a goodbye. I wish you luck with everything in your future and I know for a fact that you can do anything you set out to do. It truly was a pleasure to meet you.
      </li>

        <strong>Luis says</strong> - Through the years we've seen many characters exemplifying the different facets of your personality. They have all been grounded in honesty, beauty and your urge to do good. Whether it was a pious man like Deku the Kenku or a loose and chill person like Calibaton you were there for us. You often take whichever roll is needed for the group, even playing a barbarian you still remained the main support of the group and that is truly amazing. With having that same attitude in life, you'll have nothing but blessings on your path. 
      </li>
      <p>
        "This doesn't have to be a goodbye, and we all hope to stay in contact with you. No matter how much distance there is between us or how much time passes there will always be a chair for you at our games."
